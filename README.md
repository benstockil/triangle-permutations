# triangle-permutations

Usage: `{command} [width] [height] [verbosity (y/n)]`

The verbose output will output both the number of triangles and the individual vectors in `[x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3]` form.

Please use specifically a lowercase "y" or "n" for the verbosity argument (because I'm lazy).
Due to my inability to care, I haven't figured out how to get optional arguments, so this will have to do.
